    <h2>SELF INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p> 
        <u>Yaebin Kim</u> 
        <br>I have multiple talents. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul">Seoul, Korea</a>. I just graduated <a href="https://www.inha.ac.kr">university</a> and started career as a staff of Project Management Office in <a href="https://happytalk.io">MBI Solution</a>.  
        <br>Life is Challenge and I am challengeable. My life goal is 'Experience everything, Live Present'. Since my heart surgery, I decided to live the life with no regrets. 
        <br>I can speak Korean, English, Chinese and keep studying other languages. I lived in China for 3 years when I was in secondary school. The life in China gave me lots of inspirations of diversity. After my abroad life, I have been to Hongkong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, China, Japan, Taiwan, US, UK, France, Germany, Swizeland, Czech Republic, Spain, Italy, Austria.
        <br>My major is Business Administration but my interest was on Computer Technology, so I started work in IT field. My job is to support all administrative work in the projects and manage chatbot scenarios (mostly rule based).
